# k8s-cloud-app
This is a sample Python web based application used for Kubernetes practice and testing in preparation for the CKA / CKAD examinations.

This project will provide a Python Flask based web application that can use various features of Docker to control the application in a web browser. 

Docker support files needed to build a container from the source code will be provided, as well as files to deploy the application using Docker Compose or to a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart.
