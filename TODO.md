# Prototype Tasks

This section contains a set of TODO tasks that need to be implemented at a high level before the prototype phase of this project has been completed.

Once this phase has been completed most feature development should be moved into GitHub's project management capabilities (as a beta test) for more appropriate project management.


## Working prototype container
* build basic Flask web application
* launch the web application from startup.sh
* build Dockerfile with basic structure to launch startup.sh


## Application high level design
* look through CKAD references and define a set of features that need to be addressed by this project
* design a specific set of features for each of these items that need to be implemented
